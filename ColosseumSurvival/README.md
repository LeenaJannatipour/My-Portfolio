**The Game**

Colosseum Survival is a 2-player turn-based strategy game in which two players move in an M x M chessboard and put barriers around them until they are separated in two closed zones. M can have any value greater than 1. Each player will try to maximize the number of blocks in its zone to win the game. Sample game board and gameplay can be found in [Gameboard](Gameboard.png) and [Gameplay](Gameplay.gif) respectively. Our AI agent can be found here: [Student Agent](agents/student_agent.py)
